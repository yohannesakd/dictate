# Dictate

System-wide dictation for macOS in the style of Wispr Flow. Hold fn, speak, and release: the text is typed into the focused field. Speech recognition runs on this Mac with Phonon-2 on the Neural Engine.

## Build

Requirements: Apple silicon, macOS 15 or later, Xcode.

1. Get the Phonon-2 runtime (version 1.1.2):
   `git clone --branch 1.1.2 --depth 1 https://github.com/fermionresearch/phonon-coreml vendor/phonon-coreml`
2. Download the model folder from https://huggingface.co/FermionResearch/Phonon-2-CoreML into `models/Phonon-2-CoreML`.
   The build needs `manifest.json`, `decoder.bin`, `Phonon-2.mlpackage`, `NOTICE`, and `LICENSE-WEIGHTS-CC-BY-4.0.txt`.
3. Run `./make-signing-identity.sh` once. It creates a separate keychain in `signing/` with a local signing certificate. A stable signature keeps the Microphone and Accessibility grants across rebuilds.
4. Run `./build.sh`, then open `build/Dictate.app`.

The first launch prepares the model for the Neural Engine. This takes about one minute, once per Mac.

## Use

- Hold fn to talk; release to insert the text.
- Double-tap fn, or press fn + Space, for hands-free mode. Press fn again to finish.
- Esc cancels. Control + Command + V inserts the last dictation again.

Set "Press 🌐 key to" to "Do Nothing" in Keyboard settings, so fn does not also open the emoji picker or Apple Dictation.

Each dictation appends resource metrics to `~/Library/Logs/Dictate/metrics.jsonl`.
